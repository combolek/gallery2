TODO List (put your name beside large project to assign to yourself):

Global Documentation
	-Edit the CSS file (html.css) to make the docs more pleasing to the
	eye
	-Make the numbering on the FAQ not the same as the previous FAQ (use
	letters sounds like a good option) (-alindeman-)
	-Write a Preface to the documentation.
	-Review the docs and improve!!! :-) (-everyone-)

Gallery 1 Install Docs
	-Document backup_albums.php in the upgrading docs, before it's officially
	released with Gallery
        -FAQ 3.2, the section about the "/usr/bin/convert: Not a JPEG file: 
        starts with 0x0a 0x4d (/home/uspalmer/public_html/gallery/AUTHORS)."
	Verify that this has been fixed in the latest version.  I think Beckett
        talked about fixing this for good by removing -profile "*" and adding
        the arguments explicitely
        -FAQ 3.2, see if there are any other possible reasons for the image
        manipulation program to fail and add the possibility and fix to the
        <itemizedlist> list.
