   Basic HTTP Authentication allows you to add a second layer of security to
   your Gallery.  It also prevents people being able to "hotlink" albums directly
   from your albums directory.  The disadvantage is that basic HTTP authentication
   isn't compatible with Gallery authentication.  This means that if you want to
   give user permissions with the Gallery authentication system (e.g. to add
   pictures) they will have to login <emphasis>twice</emphasis>.  As such, this
   may not be the best solution for everyone, though it is the most secure.

   Setting up basic authentication is relatively simple.  It can get a little
   complex or annoying if you don't do certain things, however.  For instance,
   I recommend putting your albums directory <emphasis>inside</emphasis> your
   main Gallery directory, as a sub-directory.  This makes it easier to protect.
   If it's not already there, it's easy to move, just move it and rerun the
   <link linkend="gallery1-install.config-wizard">configuration wizard</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Now that you have the preliminaries, edit the &htaccess; file in your gallery
   directory.  Add the following
   <screen>
    AuthName "My Gallery"
    AuthUserFile /path/to/gallery/directory/.htpasswd
    AuthType Basic
    require valid-user
   </screen>
  </para>
  <para>
   Now you need to create the <filename>.htpasswd</filename> file which will contain
   usernames and passwords.  If you have shell access, use the <command>htpasswd</command>
   command, e.g. <command>htpasswd -c /path/to/gallery/directory/.htpasswd [username]</command>
   After you add one username, run the same command for the next user, without the -c flag.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you don't have shell access, you'll have to create the .htpasswd file manually.
   There are some web-based pages that will help you, for instance
   <ulink url="http://www.xs4all.nl/~remcovz/htpasswd.html">this page</ulink>.  Enter
   the username and password, and add it to the .htpasswd file in your Gallery directory.
   Each username and password crypt should be on a separate line.
  </para>
  <para>
   After you have that setup, basic authentication should work!
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    Because you edited your &htaccess; file in your Gallery directory, you will
    have to re-add these lines if you re-run the configuration wizard.
