Setup Instructions
The only project that needs to go in the htdocs directory is the gx project.

Then edit the gx\index.php and change the following config parameters
    $kohana_application = '<where the gxCode ended up>\application';
    $kohana_modules = '<where the gxCode ended up>\gxCode\modules';
    $kohana_system = '<where the Kohanaended up>\system';
as well don't forget to change the directory separators appropriately
