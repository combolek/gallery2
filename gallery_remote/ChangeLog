2002-10-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b7)
	
	* Added image resize before upload (this requires ImageMagick and can be enabled by 
		changing the variables resizeTo and resizeBeforeUpload in
		GalleryRemote.properties.

		this enabled. Release builds will only check for new releases, unless
		otherwise specified.

	* Added multi-album upload! Add pictures to different albums and click Upload
		Albums.
	* Almost complete rewrite of GalleryComm. Maybe it will be more robust, maybe
		more broken.
	* The preferences file is now called GalleryRemote.properties and resides in GalleryRemote
		in the home directory. This should fix problems with preferences not being saved
		but it means users will have to either copy the preferences file over themselves
		or recreate their preferences.
	* The file input dialog now accepts more types of media.
	* Fixed bug 612281: redirects needed two clicks.
	* Fixed bug 521237: non-unique album titles would confuse the Albums combo-box.

	* Bug fixes:

		  thread would think that the upload was done and reset the
		  file list before the upload thread got a chance to upload.

		  existing list.
