2003-09-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b4)

	* Implemented auto-rotate based on EXIF tag, if present. Now I need
	  protocol support to disable auto-rotate in the server when
	  uploading.
	* Implemented shutdown on upload completion. Thanks to Nick77.

2003-09-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b3)

	* Fixed PHPNuke default URLs (thanks docmattman).
	* When a read-only album is selected, drag-and-drop is not allowed
	  and the Add Pictures... button is disabled.
	* When creating a new album, select the album in the popup rather
	  than the first root album (only with G 1.4.1-b75 and later,
	  remote protocol 2.5).
	* Forcing file name on uploaded files to original filename, rather
	  than the temp file used when resizing and/or rotating (only with
	  G 1.4.1-b75 and later, remote protocol 2.5).

2003-09-21  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b2)

	* Implemented PHPNuke support (thanks docmattman).

2003-09-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b1)

	* Integrated patch by Markus Cozowicz to provide feedback during long
	  uploads. Thanks Markus!
	* Created a new modal progress dialog for uploads. It shows much
	  more info, and is cancelable. The normal progress bar has been
	  improved to be less fickle when two things happen at the same
	  time.
	* Optionally ignore the return code of spawned applications. This is
	  to work around what I think is a Java VM bug on Linux where the
	  return code is wrong.
	* Amedeo Paglione started work on i18n. A simple framework is in place
	  and he's starting to externalize all UI strings.

2003-09-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1)

	* Shipped GR 1.1

2003-09-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-RC1-b1)

	* Fixed incompatibility with Java 1.3: I was trying to catch an exception
	  that Java 1.3 doesn't know about, so the class was not even loadable.
	* GR is now built for the Mac differently than for other architectures.
	  MacOS enjoys something akin to the "French Exception". Or in this case
	  the Italian exception, since this was led by Amedeo Paglione.

2003-08-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-RC1)

	* Catching error when using SSL with an untrusted server
	  certificate.

2003-07-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b14)

	* Added keyboard handling so when the user is editing captions
	  and extra fields, the tab and up/down arrows do the expected and
	  useful thing (thanks joel558).

2003-07-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b13)

	* Added a jpegQuality field to the ImageMagick settings.
	* Better handling of null username or password.
	* Clearing cookies when Log out is clicked, so it's possible
	  to log in with different credentials without having to restart GR.

2003-07-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b12)

	* Uses a shutdown handler on Mac for those folks who use Cmd-Q to quit.
	  Mac integration is sorely lacking. I need a Mac guy to help out.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b11)

	* Fixed losing field values when more than one extrafield is used
	  (thanks Joel)
	* Filtering out extrafields "Upload Date" and "Capture Date", which
	  are not editable (thanks Joel).
	* Temporarily building jpegtran in the zip patches until it's in the
	  installer.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b10)

	* Added ability for QuickConfig to handle gallery URLs (you need
	  to use url.99, or any other set of parameters as long as the
	  parameter ends in .99. This can be used to very easily add a
	  Gallery URL to GR, especially useful for CMS.
	* If username and/or password are not set, GalleryComm2 asks for
	  them. This is necessary for when passwords are not saved.
	* An empty Gallery object is no longer created when none have been
	  declared.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b9)

	* Implemented extra fields in UI and protocol.
	* New prefs panel: Quick Config, to help newbies set their
	  configuration to match the prefs of your gallery. This is me
	  pursuing my own agenda :-)

2003-06-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b8)

	* Implemented a new way to communicate with the server for getting
	  the list of albums, which is much more efficient because only
	  writable albums and their parents are sent, and because the server
	  does less work. This should fix one of the causes for socket exceptions
	  because listing the albums takes less time.
	* Since this new format is also hierarchical, this also paves the way for
	  an album tree component rather than a flat list (no implementation yet).
	* Fixed preview frame popping up before main frame.

2003-06-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b7)

	* Fixed rotation combined with flipping, fixed losing EXIF.
	* Picture added using the Browse button now appended to the
	  list instead of prepending them.

2003-06-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b6)

	* Implemented rotate-before-upload based on jpegtran.

2003-06-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b5)

	* Truncating long URLs in UI to make it nicer when CMS URLs are
	  used.
	* Added UI for rotating pictures before upload. Actual rotation
	  of pictures not implemented yet: only thumbnails.
	* Added icons on most buttons and menu items.

2003-06-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b4)

	* Reorganized event handling and data modeling for more
	  simplicity and robustness. Phewww...
	* Fixed creating top-level albums in some cases.
	* Fixed logging out.
	* Can now create a first album when no Album is available.
	* Removed the Username and password fields in MainFrame.
	* Preferences can be invoked in such a way that it jumps
	  to a panel immediately.
	* Fixed losing caption when selecting more than one picture.
	* Fixed drag-n-dropping folders.
	* Unhacked list selection.
	* Modified HTTPConnection so it can be instanciated on Java 1.3
	  even though https is not supported.

2003-06-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b3)

	* Preference property names are now constants in PreferenceNames rather
	  than just text litterals.
	* Added proxy support in the preferences.
	* Explicit HTTPS support (see the ReadMe).
	* Optionally strips the extension when using filename for caption.

2003-06-04  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b2)

	* Added Upload, URLs, Proxy prefs panel.
	* Time in the logs is now in ms since application launch.
	* Sorted preferences files, for better readability.
	* Now pre-loading thumbnails and accurate file size when opening
	  saved state.
	* Reworked the Gallery class for more consistency and robustness.
	* Proxy panel is not yet functional.
	* Logging on to a PostNuke-embedded Gallery fails (I need help with this).

	* Added first embryo of a preferences dialog.

2003-06-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1)

	* No changes from RC1.
	* Non-Win32 builds get ImageMagick directory with instructions
	  on how to set it up.

2003-05-28  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-RC1)

	* No changes from b6.
	* No longer building 'run' batch scripts: running GR is now only
	  with the native InstallAnywhere launcher or ant.

2003-05-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b6)

	* When an auth error occurs, made the error message more informative.

2003-05-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b5)

	* No changes, just updated the automated build system to build the 1.0.x
	  branch rather than the new 1.1.x branch.

2003-05-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b4)

	* Improved stability of upload when IM is not installed.
	* Optionally HTML-escaping captions and titles during upload.
	* Display captions in the picture list.

	  Gallery's 'debug' flag was set.
	* Reformatted many source files using IdeaJ.

2003-02-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b3)

	  HTTP security. Thanks Stanley!
	* GR no longer checks the version before actual login.

2002-12-15  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b2)

	* Fixed selecting "Gallery main page" in the New Album dialog.

	* Corrected a small path problem in ImageUtils.
	* Bumped GalleryComm2 protocol version to 2.1.
	* Added client UI support for creating new albums.
	  The corresponding protocol support is not yet ready
	  so the button will remain disabled.
	* Added resizeToDefault property for resizing before upload with
	  protocol 1 and using default album size with protocol 2.

2002-10-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b10)

	* Fixed adding a Gallery (broken in b9).
	* Added undetermined progress bar to Fetch Albums.

2002-10-11 Tim Miller <tim_miller@users.sourceforge.net> (1.0-b9)

	* NOTE: GR CAN BE RUN IN GR PROTO 2 MODE BY CHANGING THE
	  protocolVersion IN THE PROPERTIES FILE.
	  THIS WILL ALL PAN OUT WITH THE NEXT CHECKIN -- GR WILL DYNAMICALLY
	  BIND TO THE NEWEST SERVER PROTOCOL. FOR NOW, CAVEAT EMPTOR.
	* Made GalleryComm and interface, moved GalleryComm implementation to
	  GalleryComm1.java.
	* Created GalleryComm2.java, based on GalleryComm1.java to implement
	  version 2 of the GR protocol.
	* Moved status interaction between GalleryComm classes and MainFrame

	* Updated Gallery Remote proto version 2 document to describe
	  user permission attributes (read, write, change, delete) on
	  Album objects.
	* paour: Added support for resizing images based on server autoResize
	  size (only with protocol 2)

	* Added image resize before upload (this requires ImageMagick and can be enabled by
		changing the variables resizeTo and resizeBeforeUpload in
		GalleryRemote.properties.
	* Added automatic update notification for betas, too. Beta builds will come with
		this enabled. Release builds will only check for new releases, unless
		otherwise specified.

	* Added multi-album upload! Add pictures to different albums and click Upload
		Albums.
	* Almost complete rewrite of GalleryComm. Maybe it will be more robust, maybe
		more broken.
	* The preferences file is now called GalleryRemote.properties and resides in GalleryRemote
		in the home directory. This should fix problems with preferences not being saved
		but it means users will have to either copy the preferences file over themselves
		or recreate their preferences.
	* The file input dialog now accepts more types of media.
	* Fixed bug 612281: redirects needed two clicks.
	* Fixed bug 521237: non-unique album titles would confuse the Albums combo-box.

	* Fixed inspector state when deleting pictures
	* Now saving multiple profiles for different Galleries (use the URL combo box)

2002-09-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b2)

	* Now optionally using ImageMagick to load thumbnails and preview, for a 5x speedup
	  and better memory management. In the future, we'll use IM to also
	  offer client-side resize and rotate.

2002-08-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b1)

	* Reorganized storage of list of files to upload in preparation for XML serialization

	* App now remembers the last used Gallery URL, username and password.

	* Bug fixes:
		- Trailing slash no longer required on Gallery URL.
		- Fixed race condtion where if login took too long the ui
		  thread would think that the upload was done and reset the
		  file list before the upload thread got a chance to upload.
		- Fetching Albums more than once will no longer append to the
		  existing list.

2001-11-14  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com> (0.3-b1)
