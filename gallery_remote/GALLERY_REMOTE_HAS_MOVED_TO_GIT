Where did all the Gallery Remote files go?

We've switched from using the Subversion revision control system to
using Git.  You can switch too.  It's easy.

1) Back up a level and delete this directory.

2) Run this command:
  $ git clone git://github.com/gallery/gallery-remote.git

That's all.  You now have the latest code.  Any time you want a newer
copy of the code, just run "git pull" .
