<h1 align="center">Gallery Remote roadmap</h1>
<h2>Document goal</h2>
<p>Serve as a basis for team and community discussions about the 
future of Gallery Remote and loosely synchronize its development to that of 
Gallery 2. </p>
<h2>Versions</h2>
<h3>0.3 [Summer 2001]</h3>
<p>Last release by Chris</p>
<h3>0.4 [August 2002]</h3>
<p>Initial release by Pierre</p>
<ul>
  <li>preview and thumbnails</li>
  <li>new installer</li>
  <li>misc bugs and features</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.5 and later: Mop-up [Fall and Winter 2002]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Take care of remaining bugs (sub-albums with same name)</li>
  <li>small new features</li>
</ul>
<p>This will take place on a maintenance branch, concurrently with 
development of 1.0.</p>
<h3>1.0: UI rewrite [October 2002]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>rewrite UI (GridBag, flexible UI)</li>
  <li>preferences dialog</li>
  <li>new features: resize image before upload, upload with caption, 
  reorder existing album, create album, batch uploading</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.0 [Summer 2003, in synch with G2 release]</h3>
<p>The goal of this release is to open up Gallery to all kinds of 
remote apps, via the creation of SOAP bindings into the core.</p>
<p>Most or all Core functionality would be exposed as SOAP calls. A 
Java Gallery SDK would be created, which would replicate PHP objects to allow 
remote Java applications to perform actions on a gallery remotely and without 
having to worry about SOAP. Gallery Remote 2 (GR2) would be one such app.</p>
<p>Usage case scenarios for GR2 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reordering existing albums</li>
  <li>moving pictures between galleries off-line</li>
  <li>creating off-line galleries</li>
  <li>editing comments and images</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the design constraints for GR2 is to not delay G2 by not 
requiring Core modifications. I hope that's possible.</p>
<h3>2.5 [Winter 2003]</h3>
<p>In this release, we include the possibility to influence Core 
development to support some of the features that were not supported by Gallery 
2.0's core.</p>
<h2>Web site actions</h2>
<h3>Icon and splash competition</h3>
<p>In the Gallery news and on the mailing lists, call for artistically-oriented 
people to contribute an icon set (ideally MacOS X, 32x32 and 16x16 icons) and 
image for the splash screen/about box of GR.</p>
<p>All contributors' submissions can be hosted on the Community gallery and 
winner will be credited in Readme and about box.</p>
