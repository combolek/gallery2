2003-06-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b8)

	* Implemented a new way to communicate with the server for getting
	  the list of albums, which is much more efficient because only
	  writable albums and their parents are sent, and because the server
	  does less work. This should fix one of the causes for socket exceptions
	  because listing the albums takes less time.
	* Since this new format is also hierarchical, this also paves the way for
	  an album tree component rather than a flat list (no implementation yet).
	* Fixed preview frame popping up before main frame.

2003-06-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b7)

	  THIS WILL ALL PAN OUT WITH THE NEXT CHECKIN -- GR WILL DYNAMICALLY
	  BIND TO THE NEWEST SERVER PROTOCOL. FOR NOW, CAVEAT EMPTOR.

	  GalleryComm1.java.

		Albums.
	* Almost complete rewrite of GalleryComm. Maybe it will be more robust, maybe
		more broken.
