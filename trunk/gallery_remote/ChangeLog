2003-12-08  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b8)

	* Load/save improvements by Scott Gartner.
	* Made it possible to run GR (in much-degraded mode) with no libraries
	  and no icons, with java -jar GalleryRemote.jar
	* Fixed StackOverflow with corrupted Galleries that caused GR to hang while
	  logging in.
	* Initial support for client-side or applet slideshow.
	* Pruned .java files from JSX library, making it lighter and resolving a
	  conflict with recent versions of IntelliJ.

2003-12-03  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b7)

	* Merged changes from the recently released GR 1.2.

2003-11-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b6)

	* Refined the file saving UI, adding Save As and Close, as well as updating
	  the window title to reflect whether state has been updated and not saved
	  and save file name. These changes were created by Scott Gartner.

2003-11-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b5)

	* Changed GRI18n to make it a static class and simplified all the classes using
	  GRI18n.
	* Finalized Album tree and Album inspector (although changing album settings
	  is not implemented because protocol support is not yet ready).
	* Implemented drag and drop of pictures to the album tree.
	* Implemented preview of pictures already on server. This will also be used for
	  the slideshow mode.

2003-11-14  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b4)

	* Changed default URL for PHPNuke (removed the /nuke path, thanks ozgreg).
	* Implemented fetching images already on server. Right now, other than looking at
	  the thumbnails, you can't really do anything with them.
	* Many infrastructure changes to support this.

2003-11-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b3)

	* Fixed a problem with loading state. Saved states from pervious versions can
	  NOT be loaded, no error dialog is shown, a big exception is dumped to the log.
	* Fixed logging out of a Gallery.
	* Made albums with content bold in the JTree.
	* Inspectors are now scrollable for small trees.
	* Thanks to Scott Gartner for these suggestions (and others).

2003-11-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b2)

	* Implemented drag-and-drop on Albums. Moving pictures from one album to another
	  is finally very easy.
	* Finished hooking up the UI in the AlbumInspector. Downloading pictures
	  from the server and updating album settings is not yet implemented.
	* Set default button for each dialog, so hitting Enter is the same as
	  clicking OK.

2003-11-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b1)

	* Albums are now displayed as a tree control
	* Album Inspector added (not yet fully functionnal)
	* this is a preliminary release

2003-11-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2)

	* Release
	* Fixed the usual Java 1.3 bug.

2003-11-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b15)

	* Fixed jpegtran execution on platforms other than Win32 (bad command line)
	* Added more debug when executing external commands (now prints stdout and stderr
	  from external command to log).
	* For Mac build, added im.properties and jpegtran.properties to img.jar
	  so Mac app can be completely self-contained.
	* thanks to Amedeo Paglione for suggesting above fixes.

2003-11-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b14)

	* Almost complete rewrite of drag and drop code, fixing all the known bugs
	* Implemented cut-copy-paste for the list of pictures, so pictures can
	  now at long last be moved between albums (before upload)!
	* Fixed the QuickConfig preference not updating the other preference panels.
	  The fix is to close the preference dialog after QuickConfig is used, to
	  prevent conflicts.

2003-11-03  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b13)

	* Better memory management for thumbnails and previews. Memory errors
	  should be rarer, and thumbnail/preview generation should be quicker.
	* Added button to sort files alphabetically in an album.
	* GR should now find jpegtran and ImageMagick in that if they are
	  available in the PATH on non-Windows platforms. Added a long-winded
	  warning at the tail-end of the installer about how to install them.

2003-10-30  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b12)

	* Added warning when logging out or quitting and pictures are left in
	  a gallery, so no data is lost.
	* Updated bundled ImageMagick (windows only) to 5.5.7, added lib needed
	  for PNG images.
	* Fixed URL preferences getting lost.
	* Added disambiguation when 2 URLs for the same Gallery, but with different
	  usernames are present.
	* Fixed Quick Config losing the gallery type.

2003-10-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b11)

	* Implemented patching mechanism for LAX file when the classpath
	  needs to be changed.
	* Build process can now update Menalto.com with the latest build information
	  so automated daily builds are automatically propagated. Also now pushing
	  beta builds to jpmullan.com.
	* Cosmetic changes to the Log class.

2003-10-06  Amedeo Paglione <apaglione@mac.com> (1.2-b10)

	* Adoption of more generic locale
	* Optimized the procedure for locale loading

2003-10-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b9)

	* Better display for languages in the prefs dialog.
	* Changed from using a Java 1.4-only method to a standard method.
	  This was causing GR not to start under 1.3 VMs.

2003-09-30  Amedeo Paglione <apaglione@mac.com> (1.2-b8)

	* Implemented list of available locale resources.

2003-09-30  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b7)

	* Implemented UI in Preferences/General to select the locale
	  among the available locales.

2003-09-29  Amedeo Paglione <apaglione@mac.com> (1.2-b6)

	* Internationalized all strings in GR. English and Italian versions
	  available.

2003-09-27  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b5)

	* After images are removed from the list, another image is selected.
	  This has been a long-standing irritant...
	* Moving more than one picture up or down is now possible.
	* Suppressing auto-rotation on the server when the user manually
	  rotates the image or GR rotates it based on the EXIF data.

2003-09-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b4)

	* Implemented auto-rotate based on EXIF tag, if present. Now I need
	  protocol support to disable auto-rotate in the server when
	  uploading.
	* Implemented shutdown on upload completion. Thanks to Nick77.

2003-09-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b3)

	* Fixed PHPNuke default URLs (thanks docmattman).
	* When a read-only album is selected, drag-and-drop is not allowed
	  and the Add Pictures... button is disabled.
	* When creating a new album, select the album in the popup rather
	  than the first root album (only with G 1.4.1-b75 and later,
	  remote protocol 2.5).
	* Forcing file name on uploaded files to original filename, rather
	  than the temp file used when resizing and/or rotating (only with
	  G 1.4.1-b75 and later, remote protocol 2.5).

2003-09-21  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b2)

	* Implemented PHPNuke support (thanks docmattman).

2003-09-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b1)

	* Integrated patch by Markus Cozowicz to provide feedback during long
	  uploads. Thanks Markus!
	* Created a new modal progress dialog for uploads. It shows much
	  more info, and is cancelable. The normal progress bar has been
	  improved to be less fickle when two things happen at the same
	  time.
	* Optionally ignore the return code of spawned applications. This is
	  to work around what I think is a Java VM bug on Linux where the
	  return code is wrong.
	* Amedeo Paglione started work on i18n. A simple framework is in place
	  and he's starting to externalize all UI strings.

2003-09-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1)

	* Shipped GR 1.1

2003-09-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-RC1-b1)

	* Fixed incompatibility with Java 1.3: I was trying to catch an exception
	  that Java 1.3 doesn't know about, so the class was not even loadable.
	* GR is now built for the Mac differently than for other architectures.
	  MacOS enjoys something akin to the "French Exception". Or in this case
	  the Italian exception, since this was led by Amedeo Paglione.

2003-08-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-RC1)

	* Catching error when using SSL with an untrusted server
	  certificate.

2003-07-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b14)

	* Added keyboard handling so when the user is editing captions
	  and extra fields, the tab and up/down arrows do the expected and
	  useful thing (thanks joel558).

2003-07-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b13)

	* Added a jpegQuality field to the ImageMagick settings.
	* Better handling of null username or password.
	* Clearing cookies when Log out is clicked, so it's possible
	  to log in with different credentials without having to restart GR.

2003-07-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b12)

	* Uses a shutdown handler on Mac for those folks who use Cmd-Q to quit.
	  Mac integration is sorely lacking. I need a Mac guy to help out.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b11)

	* Fixed losing field values when more than one extrafield is used
	  (thanks Joel)
	* Filtering out extrafields "Upload Date" and "Capture Date", which
	  are not editable (thanks Joel).
	* Temporarily building jpegtran in the zip patches until it's in the
	  installer.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b10)

	* Added ability for QuickConfig to handle gallery URLs (you need
	  to use url.99, or any other set of parameters as long as the
	  parameter ends in .99. This can be used to very easily add a
	  Gallery URL to GR, especially useful for CMS.
	* If username and/or password are not set, GalleryComm2 asks for
	  them. This is necessary for when passwords are not saved.
	* An empty Gallery object is no longer created when none have been
	  declared.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b9)

	* Implemented extra fields in UI and protocol.
	* New prefs panel: Quick Config, to help newbies set their
	  configuration to match the prefs of your gallery. This is me
	  pursuing my own agenda :-)

2003-06-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b8)

	* Implemented a new way to communicate with the server for getting
	  the list of albums, which is much more efficient because only
	  writable albums and their parents are sent, and because the server
	  does less work. This should fix one of the causes for socket exceptions
	  because listing the albums takes less time.
	* Since this new format is also hierarchical, this also paves the way for
	  an album tree component rather than a flat list (no implementation yet).
	* Fixed preview frame popping up before main frame.

2003-06-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b7)

	* Fixed rotation combined with flipping, fixed losing EXIF.
	* Picture added using the Browse button now appended to the
	  list instead of prepending them.

2003-06-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b6)

	* Implemented rotate-before-upload based on jpegtran.

2003-06-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b5)

	* Truncating long URLs in UI to make it nicer when CMS URLs are
	  used.
	* Added UI for rotating pictures before upload. Actual rotation
	  of pictures not implemented yet: only thumbnails.
	* Added icons on most buttons and menu items.

2003-06-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b4)

	* Reorganized event handling and data modeling for more
	  simplicity and robustness. Phewww...
	* Fixed creating top-level albums in some cases.
	* Fixed logging out.
	* Can now create a first album when no Album is available.
	* Removed the Username and password fields in MainFrame.
	* Preferences can be invoked in such a way that it jumps
	  to a panel immediately.
	* Fixed losing caption when selecting more than one picture.
	* Fixed drag-n-dropping folders.
	* Unhacked list selection.
	* Modified HTTPConnection so it can be instanciated on Java 1.3
	  even though https is not supported.

2003-06-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b3)

	* Preference property names are now constants in PreferenceNames rather
	  than just text litterals.
	* Added proxy support in the preferences.
	* Explicit HTTPS support (see the ReadMe).
	* Optionally strips the extension when using filename for caption.

2003-06-04  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b2)

	* Added Upload, URLs, Proxy prefs panel.
	* Time in the logs is now in ms since application launch.
	* Sorted preferences files, for better readability.
	* Now pre-loading thumbnails and accurate file size when opening
	  saved state.
	* Reworked the Gallery class for more consistency and robustness.
	* Proxy panel is not yet functional.
	* Logging on to a PostNuke-embedded Gallery fails (I need help with this).

	* Added first embryo of a preferences dialog.

2003-06-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1)

	* No changes from RC1.
	* Non-Win32 builds get ImageMagick directory with instructions
	  on how to set it up.

2003-05-28  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-RC1)

	* No changes from b6.
	* No longer building 'run' batch scripts: running GR is now only
	  with the native InstallAnywhere launcher or ant.

2003-05-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b6)

	* When an auth error occurs, made the error message more informative.

2003-05-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b5)

	* No changes, just updated the automated build system to build the 1.0.x
	  branch rather than the new 1.1.x branch.

2003-05-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b4)

	* Improved stability of upload when IM is not installed.
	* Optionally HTML-escaping captions and titles during upload.
	* Display captions in the picture list.

	  uploading, in case of a problem).
	* Fixed a problem with uploading pictures to Gallery when the
	  Gallery's 'debug' flag was set.
	* Reformatted many source files using IdeaJ.

2003-02-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b3)

	* Integrated Stanley Knutson's patch to handle Basic Auth
	  HTTP security. Thanks Stanley!
	* GR no longer checks the version before actual login.

2002-12-15  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b2)

	* Fixed selecting "Gallery main page" in the New Album dialog.

	* Added support for the "new-album" command to GalleryComm2.
	* Corrected a small path problem in ImageUtils.
	* Bumped GalleryComm2 protocol version to 2.1.
	* Added client UI support for creating new albums.
	  The corresponding protocol support is not yet ready
	  so the button will remain disabled.
	* Added resizeToDefault property for resizing before upload with
	  protocol 1 and using default album size with protocol 2.

2002-10-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b10)

	* Fixed adding a Gallery (broken in b9).
	* Added undetermined progress bar to Fetch Albums.

2002-10-11 Tim Miller <tim_miller@users.sourceforge.net> (1.0-b9)

	* NOTE: GR CAN BE RUN IN GR PROTO 2 MODE BY CHANGING THE
	  protocolVersion IN THE PROPERTIES FILE.
	  THIS WILL ALL PAN OUT WITH THE NEXT CHECKIN -- GR WILL DYNAMICALLY
	  BIND TO THE NEWEST SERVER PROTOCOL. FOR NOW, CAVEAT EMPTOR.
	* Made GalleryComm and interface, moved GalleryComm implementation to
	  GalleryComm1.java.
	* Created GalleryComm2.java, based on GalleryComm1.java to implement
	  version 2 of the GR protocol.
	* Moved status interaction between GalleryComm classes and MainFrame

	* Fixed another Java 1.3 bug where the Album combo box was not working

2002-10-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b7)

	* Added image resize before upload (this requires ImageMagick and can be enabled by
		changing the variables resizeTo and resizeBeforeUpload in
		GalleryRemote.properties.
	* Added automatic update notification for betas, too. Beta builds will come with
		this enabled. Release builds will only check for new releases, unless
		otherwise specified.

	* Added multi-album upload! Add pictures to different albums and click Upload
		Albums.
	* Almost complete rewrite of GalleryComm. Maybe it will be more robust, maybe
		more broken.
	* The preferences file is now called GalleryRemote.properties and resides in GalleryRemote
		in the home directory. This should fix problems with preferences not being saved
		but it means users will have to either copy the preferences file over themselves
		or recreate their preferences.
	* The file input dialog now accepts more types of media.
	* Fixed bug 612281: redirects needed two clicks.
	* Fixed bug 521237: non-unique album titles would confuse the Albums combo-box.

	* Switched to an Ant-based build system
	* Fixed inspector state when deleting pictures
	* Now saving multiple profiles for different Galleries (use the URL combo box)

2002-09-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b2)

	* Now optionally using ImageMagick to load thumbnails and preview, for a 5x speedup
	  and better memory management. In the future, we'll use IM to also
	  offer client-side resize and rotate.

2002-08-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b1)

	* Reorganized storage of list of files to upload in preparation for XML serialization

	* Rewrote main frame UI for flexibility and robustness
	* Now also saving password to preferences file (should be made customizable)
	* Added unix make and run shell scripts

	* v0.3 ships!

2001-11-20  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com> (0.3-b2)

	* App now remembers the last used Gallery URL, username and password.

	* Bug fixes:
		- Trailing slash no longer required on Gallery URL.
		- Fixed race condtion where if login took too long the ui
		  thread would think that the upload was done and reset the
		  file list before the upload thread got a chance to upload.
		- Fetching Albums more than once will no longer append to the
		  existing list.

2001-11-14  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com> (0.3-b1)

	* Renamed package and main class from GalleryUp to GalleryRemote.

2001-11-12  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com> (0.2)
