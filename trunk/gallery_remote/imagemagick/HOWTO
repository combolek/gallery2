To enable ImageMagick support for your platform, copy the "im.properties" in the 
corresponding folder to this folder. You should only need to do this if you got 
Gallery Remote from the CVS repository.

If you already have ImageMagick installed on your system, just rename the 
"im.properties.preinstalled" to "im.properties" and set the "imConvertPath" 
property to the exact path to the Convert executable in your ImageMagick 
installation.

If you compiled ImageMagick for a platform we don't already have support for, 
please get in touch with me at paour@sourceforge.net so we can include your 
binaries in our standard distributions.
