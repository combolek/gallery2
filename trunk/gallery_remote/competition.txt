Gallery Remote needs an icon and a banner/about box image, and we would like to appeal to the community to design one, so...


* WELCOME TO THE GALLERY REMOTE ICON COMPETITION *


What we are looking for in order of decreasing importance:

* Icons: 16x16 (small icon), 32x32 (normal icon), 128x128 (Mac OS X icon), in full color, to be used as the executable file icon

* Banner/Splash-screen/about box: any size, use your judgement

* Web buttons that we can use to publicize Gallery Remote: any standard size

Of course, the more complete a proposal, the more attractive it will be, but we will attempt to use the best pieces of any proposal. I'm personally biased toward colorful and dynamic, yet legible when it comes to icons and buttons :-)

All submissions will be posted on the community site for visitors to comment on, and will remain there. The winning submission will be used ruthlessly for Gallery Remote and the web site.

To submit a proposal, send it to paour@sourceforge.net.

Thanks for participating!


The Gallery Remote team.
