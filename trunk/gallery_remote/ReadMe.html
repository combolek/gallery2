<h2><a name="whatisGR" id="whatisGR"></a>What is Gallery Remote?</h2>
<p>Gallery Remote is a desktop file upload utility for Gallery.</p>
<p>It works best with newer versions of Gallery. Gallery 1.3.2 and later support 
  a new protocol, which allows uploading captions along with images, creating 
  new albums, etc.</p>
<p>Gallery Remote is licensed under the GPL.</p>

<h2><a name="whatisG"></a>What is Gallery?</h2>
<p>Gallery is a web-based photo album viewer/creator. For the latest information, 
  check out the web site:</p>
<p><a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">http://gallery.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<h2><a name="using"></a>Using Gallery Remote</h2>
<p>You're on your own here, but it's pretty straightforward.</p>
<h3>Preferences</h3>
<p>Even though there is now a Preferences dialog, the preference files can still 
  be edited. You should not modify the <code>defaults.properties</code> file, 
  but you should read it to understand what each preference does. Then, you can 
  edit the <code>GalleryRemote.properties</code> (it is created the first time 
  GR is run) and add or replace the preferences you want to change.</p>
<p>The preferences files used to be stored in the same directory as the GalleryRemote 
  executable, and has been moved (and renamed) to the current user's home directory. 
  On recent versions of Windows, this is the <code>Documents and Settings/<em>&lt;username&gt;</em></code> 
  directory in the boot partition. When you upgrade from versions older than 1.0b6, 
  you will lose your current preferences unless you copy the previously used <code>remote.properties</code> 
  to <code><em>&lt;home directory&gt;</em>/.GalleryRemote/GalleryRemote.properties</code>.</p>
<h3>ImageMagick setup</h3>
<p>GR will use ImageMagick (IM) to speed up (very greatly) the computation of 
  resized images for thumbnails, preview and image upload.</p>
<p>On Windows, the installer will automatically install and set up a subset of 
  the IM functionality, so there is nothing special to do.</p>
<p>On other platforms, you should install IM separately (<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org/</a>) 
  and tell GR by renaming the <code>im.properties.preinstalled</code> to <code>im.properties</code> 
  and set the <code>imConvertPath</code> property to the exact path to the Convert 
  executable in your ImageMagick installation.</p>
<p>We will add more platform support as time goes on, but we may need help. If 
  you compiled ImageMagick for a platform we don't already have support for, please 
  get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:paour@users.sourceforge.net">paour@users.sourceforge.net</a> 
  so we can include your binaries in our standard distributions.</p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>If you encounter a problem, the logging system may be some help, and we will 
  definitely request it if you ask for support.</p>
<p>By default, GR writes most log information to the file <code>log.txt</code> 
  in the directory where you installed GR. If you want to see more detailed information 
  there, you can add the following lines to your <code>GalleryRemote.properties</code> 
  file:</p>
<pre>logLevel=3
toSysOut=true</pre>
<p>If you also change your InstallAnywhere launcher file <code>Gallery Remote.lax</code> to 
  set:</p>
<pre>lax.stdout.redirect=console</pre>
<p>you will see the log as it unfolds in the console...</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Be careful before posting your log to forums or sending 
  it to anyone: your password is printed in clear text in several places.</p>
<h3>Saving/loading</h3>
<p> In order to attempt to guarantee that you will not lose your hard work if 
  the upload doesn't work and Gallery Remote doesn't recover gracefully, it will 
  save the project before attempting to upload into the same folder your Gallery 
  Remote options file resides. If something does happen, you can load the project 
  again, and even modify it (it's XML).</p>
<p>You can also save and open a project at any time.</p>
<p>Project files use the extension .grg (for Gallery Remote gallery); this extension 
  is not automatically mapped to Gallery Remote (you can't double click the project 
  files and expect something useful to happen).</p>
<h3>HTTPS</h3>
<p>You can use https:// URLs with Gallery Remote to connect to secured web sites. 
  This functionality is only available on Java 1.4 and later.</p>
<p>If the site you are attempting to connect to uses a server certificate that 
  is not certified by a trusted certificate authority, Gallery Remote will be 
  unable to connect. If that happens, you will need to add the site's certificate 
  to the Java registry of trusted certificates. The process for doing this is 
  detailed <a href="http://www.infy.com/knowledge_capital/thought-papers/usingHTTPwith_java.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="run"></a>Can I run Gallery Remote on platforms for which there is 
  no installer?</h2>
<p>Yes, maybe. Gallery Remote was written in Java. If you have Java 1.3 or later
  installed on your machine, you may be able to run the app with the command:</p>
<pre>java -cp GalleryRemote.jar com.gallery.GalleryRemote.GalleryRemote</pre>
<p>assuming you are in the same directory as the GalleryRemote.jar file.</p>
<h2><a name="bundled"></a>Bundled software</h2>
<h3>ImageMagick</h3>
<p>ImageMagick can be found <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">here</a>. We 
  use ImageMagick to resize images prior to uploading them. In the future, we'll 
  implement features such as watermarking or arbitrary ImageMagick manipulation.</p>
<p>JSX is licensed under its own <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/Copyright.html">license</a>.</p>
<h3>JSX</h3>
<p>JSX can be found <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ebren/JSX/">here</a>. 
  We use JSX to provide save/load support. In the future, this may be used to 
  allow external tools to automatically generate projects that can then be loaded 
  into Gallery Remote.</p>
<p>JSX is licensed under the GPL.</p>
<h2><a name="problems"></a>Known problems</h2>
<p>There are many, I am sure.</p>
<p>Right now, the lack of out of the box support for ImageMagick on non-Windows 
  platforms is one of the worst. We're looking for assistance on this to build 
  IM packages for other platforms.</p>
<p>Lack of a preferences dialogs is also of some concern. But this is what a preview 
  version is for, right?</p>
<h2><a name="help"></a>HELP!! Where do I go for Help?</h2>
<p>We're here to help you. We want you to get Gallery up and running.
  But please remember that Gallery is installed on many websites and
  the Gallery authors get bombarded with lots of emails every day.
  Be kind to us and try to use the resources we make available before
  you fire off an email to us.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do is to visit the Gallery Support Forums:</p>
<p> <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB_14&file=index">http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpBB_14&amp;file=index</a></p>
<p>and specifically the Gallery Remote forum:</p>
<p><a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB_14&file=index&action=viewforum&forum=17">http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpBB_14&amp;file=index&amp;action=viewforum&amp;forum=17</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't find your answer there, send your help requests to the
  mailing lists.</p>
<p>The Gallery users mailing list is here:</p>
<p> <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gallery-users">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gallery-users</a></p>
<p>there's an archive of all the emails for the past few months here:</p>
<p> <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gallery-users&r=1&w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gallery-users&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</a></p>
<p>We respond to each and every request for help. There are very few problems 
  that we have not been able to work through. We <strong>will</strong> get you 
  up and running. But, remember that every email we respond to robs us of time 
  that we could be spending improving the quality of Gallery and adding new features.</p>
<p>Speaking of quality and features, if you find a bug you can file
  it in our Bug Tracker:</p>
<p> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=7130&atid=107130">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=7130&amp;atid=107130</a></p>
<p>and if you think of a new feature, you can file it in our Feature
  Tracker:</p>
<p> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=357130&group_id=7130&func=browse">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=357130&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse</a></p>
<p>It's a good idea to check through these databases to see if the
  bug/feature that you're referring to is already in there.</p>
