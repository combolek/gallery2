<h1 align="center">Gallery Remote 1.0 features</h1>
<h2>Document goal</h2>
<p>Serve as a basis for team and community discussions about GR 1.0 features, 
  how they will be implemented, and by whom. </p>
<p>The goal is to ship Gallery Remote 1.0 once all P1 and P2 features have been 
  implemented. P3 and lower features will be implemented in point-releases following 
  the release of GR 1.0.</p>

      remove button, move up/down buttons, order counter, etc.</td>
