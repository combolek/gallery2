TODO List (put your name beside large project to assign to yourself):

Global Documentation
	-Edit the CSS file (html.css) to make the docs more pleasing to the
	eye
	-Make the numbering on the FAQ not the same as the previous FAQ (use
	letters sounds like a good option) (-alindeman-)

Gallery 1 Install Docs
	-Document backup_albums.php in the upgrading docs, before it's officially
	released with Gallery
