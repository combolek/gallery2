 <title>Installing Required Programs</title>
 
 <para>
  Gallery, being PHP, cannot do all of the complex image operations required to
  resize and otherwise manipulate images by itself.  It requires other programs
  to be able to do this, and you must install these programs or Gallery cannot
  work.

   <para>
    NetPBM is easy to install yourself. You can grab the files from
    the <ulink
    url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php&#63;group_id=7130">Gallery
    Download Page</ulink>. You do not need root access; just upload
    the <filename>NetPBM</filename> files via your FTP client (in
    <emphasis>binary</emphasis> mode) and <function>CHMOD</function>
    the directory and all the files in that directory with the
    following permissions: 755. If the configuration wizard can't
    locate the <filename>NetPBM</filename> directory it will ask you
    for the exact location and you can fill in the correct path.
   </para>
   <note>
    <simpara>
     NetPBM is not required if you are using ImageMagick.

    ImageMagick is an alternative for NetPBM.  It is usually considered to be
    faster, but can be more difficult to install.  As with NetPBM, you don't
    need root access to install the binaries.  You can download ImageMagick
    builds from <ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org
    </ulink>.  Also as with NetPBM, the binaries must be chmodded 0755 (including
    the directory they are in).

    <emphasis>Display EXIF data with Jhead (Optional)</emphasis>
   </para>
   <para>
    If you want to display the EXIF information that many digital
    cameras store in JPEG images, you'll need to install a small
    program called <filename>Jhead</filename> to your webspace. A few
    hosts have begun having it pre-installed for Gallery users. If you
    are installing Jhead yourself you can install it either in the
    <filename>gallery</filename> directory or in your
    <filename>public_html</filename> directory (sometimes called
    <filename>www</filename> or something similar). If you don't need
    to display the exif information for your photos, skip this
    step.
   </para>
   <para>
    Download the pre-built executable and upload it to your webspace
    via FTP, making sure that you upload it in
    <emphasis>BINARY</emphasis> mode. If Windows has saved it with a
    <filename>.txt</filename> extension, simply remove the extension
    once you've uploaded it and call the file
    <filename>jhead</filename> (with no file
    extension). <function>CHMOD</function> this file to 755. You will
    have to fill in the path to the Jhead file when you run the
    configuration wizard.
