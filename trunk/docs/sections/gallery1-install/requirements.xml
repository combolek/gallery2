     ask your host to upgrade), until then we cannot help you.

     PHP is a web server module that allows you to create applications
     using an embedded scripting language. If you don't yet have a web
     host and are looking for one, check their site to see what their
     features and software include. If you don't see PHP listed, write
     and ask if they support PHP (while you are at it, make sure they
     run it with <function>safe mode</function> OFF). You need PHP to
     run Gallery.
    </para>
    <para>
     Run your own server? If you're on a Unix box, the odds are good
     that you'll be able to download PHP easily in either source or
     binary form for your system. As of this writing, Gallery requires
     PHP version 4.0.4pl1 or more recent. It has been tested on
     versions of PHP up to 4.2.2
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>PLEASE NOTE</emphasis>: Your PHP installation
     <emphasis>must not be in <function>safe
     mode</function></emphasis>. Gallery is a sophisticated
     application and its operations require extensive privileges. Safe
     mode prevents Gallery from functioning properly.

    <para>
     mod_rewrite (optional)
    </para>
    <para>
     mod_rewrite is an Apache module that lets web server applications
     do clever things with URLs. Gallery uses this module to allow it
     to use short URLs. In other words, you see this:
     <blockquote>
      <para>
       <ulink url="http://www.menalto.com/photos/cole-earlydays/aga">http://www.menalto.com/photos/cole-earlydays/aga</ulink>
      </para>
     </blockquote>
     instead of this:
     <blockquote>
      <para>
       <ulink url="http://www.menalto.com/photos/view_photo.php&#63;set_albumName=cole-earlydays&amp;id=aga">http://www.menalto.com/photos/view_photo.php&#63;set_albumName=cole-earlydays&amp;id=aga</ulink>
      </para>
     </blockquote>
     Obviously the shorter one is easier to remember and nicer to use
     when sending links to friends and family. Unfortunately, if you
     don't own the web server then it may be difficult or impossible to
     enable mod_rewrite, but you can always write your host and ask.

    <para>
     NetPBM is an image manipulation package that handles many, many
     file formats. It is very flexible and can be used to scale,
     rotate and convert images. Many systems will already have this
     installed. If not, you can get a binary distribution from the
     <ulink url="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php&#63;op=modload&amp;name=phpWiki&amp;file=index&amp;pagename=Download">Gallery
     Download Page</ulink>. <emphasis>You don't need to be root to
     install it on your system</emphasis>; you can just put these
     files in your home directory. If there isn't a binary
     distribution for your architecture, it's easy to compile your own
     version.
    </para>
    <para>
     As well, Gallery supports the use of <ulink
     url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</ulink>. When you
     run the configuration wizard, choose the package you wish Gallery
     to use (usually only one or the other is installed).

  <title>How to find out what you have</title>
  
  <para>
   To find out which version of Apache and PHP is installed on your
   webspace (or server), use the <filename>phpinfo.php</filename> file
   in the setup directory of Gallery to display this information, by
   typing the following in your browser window:
   
   <blockquote>
    <para>
     <ulink url="http://www.yourdomain.com/gallery/setup/phpinfo.php">http://www.yourdomain.com/gallery/setup/phpinfo.php</ulink>
    </para>
   </blockquote>
   
   This file is accessible only when Gallery is still in configure
   mode (or freshly copied to the server).

    <para>
     <ulink url="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">Jhead</ulink>: To
     extract EXIF headers out of JPEG images, you can (optionally) use
     this tool.
    </para>
    <para>
     You need to know the directory where this binary is installed,
     including the name of the binary. Usually something like this:
     <filename>/usr/local/bin/jhead</filename> .
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are installing Jhead yourself you can install it either in
     the Gallery directory or in your <filename>public_html</filename>
     directory (sometimes called <filename>www</filename> or something
     similar).
