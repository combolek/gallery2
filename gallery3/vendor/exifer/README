DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure svn export of what's in the exifer svn tree
  http://www.zenphoto.org/svn/trunk/zp-core/exif/

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what need in gallery3/modules/exif/lib


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
  # Check the upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that
  # we're synced to in your commit message!

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # after updating filters you should do:
  #  $ rm -rf modified && svn up modified && sh refresh_modified.sh
  # when you're satisfied, svn commit modified

$ cd gallery3
$ svn merge -cREV vendor/exifer/modified trunk/modules/exif/lib


VERIFYING PATCHES

We have some patches in our version of the Exifer code.  After every
update, you should verify that every one of our deviations is tracked
by a ticket on zenphoto.org.

$ svn diff https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/gallery3/vendor/exifer/modified https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/gallery3/trunk/modules/exif/lib
