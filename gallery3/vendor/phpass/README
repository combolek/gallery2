DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure copy of PHPass 0.1 from http://www.openwall.com/phpass/

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what we need in gallery3/trunk/modules/user/lib


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
  # Check the upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that
  # we're synced to in your commit message!

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # after updating filters you should do:
  #  $ rm -rf modified && svn up modified && sh refresh_modified.sh
  # when you're satisfied, svn commit modified

$ cd gallery3
$ svn merge -cREV vendor/phpass/modified trunk/modules/user/lib
