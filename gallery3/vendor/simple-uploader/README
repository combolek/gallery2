DESCRIPTION
-----------
Right now there's only one directory:

upstream:
  This is a pure svn export of what's in the simple-uploader svn tree
  http://simple-uploader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GalleryUploader/trunk


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
  # Check the upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that
  # we're synced to in your commit message!

$ cd gallery3
$ cp vendor/simple-uploader/upstream/src/GalleryUploader.swf trunk/core/SimpleUploader.swf
