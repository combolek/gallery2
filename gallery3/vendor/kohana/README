DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure svn export of what's in the Kohana svn tree
  http://source.kohanaphp.com/trunk

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what need in gallery3/trunk/kohana


UPDATING
--------
$ sh update_kohana_upstream.sh
  # Check the kohana_upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that we're
  # synced to in your commit message!

$ sh update_kohana_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in kohana_modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't want should
  # get added to the filters in update_kohana_modified.sh and after updating
  # filters you should do:
  #  $ rm -rf kohana_modified && svn up kohana_modified && sh update_kohana_modified.sh
  # when you're satisfied, svn commit kohana_modified

$ cd gallery3
$ svn merge -cREV vendor/kohana/modified/kohana trunk/kohana
$ svn merge -cREV vendor/kohana/modified/modules/unit_test trunk/modules/unit_test
