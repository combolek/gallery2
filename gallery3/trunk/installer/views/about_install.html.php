  Gallery needs to talk to your MySQL database, so to get started
  you'll need to know:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Database name </li>
  <li> Database username </li>
  <li> Database password </li>
  <li> Database host </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If you're missing any of this information, please ask your
  web host or system administrator for a little help.
